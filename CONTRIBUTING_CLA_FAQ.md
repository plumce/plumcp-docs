# Contributor License Agreement FAQ

## Why do you require a CLA?

The CLA allows the project maintainer to relicense the project in the future,
including offering commercial or proprietary versions. This helps ensure the
long-term sustainability of the project.

---

## Does this mean my contribution won’t be open source?

No. Contributions are still published as part of the project under its open
source license. The CLA simply allows the Maintainer to also use the code under
other licenses.

---

## Why do you require copyright assignment?

Copyright assignment avoids legal ambiguity and makes relicensing possible.
Without it, even small contributions could prevent future license changes.

---

## What if my employer owns my work?

If your employer owns your contributions, they must sign a **Corporate
Contributor License Agreement (CCLA)**. This is very common for open-source
projects.

---

## Can I still use my own code?

Yes. You receive a license back to use your contributions as part of the
project under its open-source license.

---

## Does this affect my existing rights?

No. You retain attribution as part of the project history, and the CLA does
not restrict your ability to use your own work outside the project.

---

## Who should I contact with questions?

Please contact **Project Maintainer** with any CLA-related questions.
